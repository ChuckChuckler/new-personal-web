                        I’m a 16 y.o programmer from the US.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-me-p">
                        I started coding in fourth grade (a term I then associated with various free courses on Grok Learning and badly-designed HTML/CSS websites composed entirely of snippets from w3schools and geeksforgeeks *glances at my Clash Royale fan website*).
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-me-p">
                        My love for coding is something that has only grown as I have. Especially after attending a Hack Club event in ninth grade, my passion for the subject grew tenfold. I am currently a high school junior; by today, I have participated in over 11 hackathons and YSWSs (You Ship We Ship), and have built over 25 coding projects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-me-p">
                        My favorite part of coding is finding creative solutions to problems I face everyday. Whether it be studying for an upcoming test, or something that facilitates my hobbies, or even just sheer boredom, I know I can turn to coding for a solution.

                        <p class="hobby-text hobby-desc">I love reading good books!<br>I read mostly classics, but I'll read anything with eloquent writing.<br>I also love reading Greek and Roman poetry. And by extension, I love all things Latin! Currently taking it in school. The language fascinates me, as well as all the literature that comes out of it. Agricola tres porcos in proelio necavit et sum discipula Linguae Latinae (ദ്ദി˙ᗜ˙)</p>

                        <p class="hobby-text hobby-desc">I've been writing maybe longer than I've been coding.<br>I absolutely love writing. Creative writing especially. APUSH is currently my favorite class; I lovelovelove writing history essays. I would enjoy english essays, but they're too strictly graded for my taste...<br>I like writing poems and short stories. And fanfiction-- a <i>lot</i> of fanfiction. No, you cannot have my Ao3 (◑_◑)</p>

                        <p class="hobby-text hobby-desc">If there was one thing I was just as passionate as coding about, if not more, it would be music. I play piano. I'm a member of both choir and the acapella group at my school. Most of all, I love music theory and making music. Perchance I'll be able to get a Soundcloud or something running sometime soon (I don't like Spotify). I hope to double major in both CS and music theory/composition in college (˶ˆᗜˆ˵)</p>
